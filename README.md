# LinkedIn Focus - LinkedIn Minimal Mode

**LinkedIn Focus** is a Chrome extension that helps you focus on *content*, not *clout*.  
It hides likes, shares, and comments from your LinkedIn feed so you're not swayed by social validation metrics.

---

## 🧠 Why Use LinkedInFocus?

We often judge content based on how many likes or comments it has — not its actual value.  
This creates bias, herd behavior, and echo chambers. **LinkedInFocus** removes that noise.
